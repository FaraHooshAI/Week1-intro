## Learning objectives

- Use basic python syntax.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

You already know Python as you proved in the interview. But it is worth a recap on the syntax of the language, mostly about how to manipulate data structures (arrays and objects). We will also look at python best practices.

### Why is refreshing your Python knowledge important?

You will be using a lot of Python in the next several projects, so it is important that you refresh your basic Python knowledge in order to write Python that follows the best practices.

### Why are Python best practices important?

If you follow best practices, working with your code will be easier - for you and for other developers.
