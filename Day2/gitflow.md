## Description

So far, you have been using GitHub flow. Now, it is time to introduce Gitflow.
The primary purpose of Gitflow is the same as in the case of the GitHub flow. It is a description of a detailed process for using branches with your team.
However, there one important difference - in Gitflow, you keep two special branches: one for development code shared with your team and one that is used only for production code.


### Why is it important?

As in the case of GitHub flow - if everybody in your team uses the same flow, you collaborate more effectively because everyone knows how to track the history of changes in your shared code easily.
Gitflow is also how many development teams in the world work, so this will definitely benefit your chances of landing your first job.
