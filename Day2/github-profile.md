## Learning objectives

- Prepare a strong GitHub profile.

### **Estimated time**: 1.5h

### Why is a strong GitHub profile so important?

Your GitHub profile is like your resume in the software world; it gives others insight into who you are, what you've done, and what you're able to do.

## Complete your GitHub bio

Your bio—the sidebar section of your GitHub profile, where visitors can see your name, portfolio, job title, etc.—is the easiest part of your GitHub profile to fill out.

## Fill out your personal README (optional, but recommended)

GitHub allows you to create a personal README file that displays at the top of your GitHub profile above the pinned projects. You can write whatever you want in this field, which allows for even more customization of your GitHub profile. This is a fantastic way to promote your work in a way that can potentially be more prominent than simply linking to your portfolio or pinning your best projects.

## Showcase your commitment with your Activity chart

The final element of a strong GitHub profile isn't something that you can complete right now: rather, it's only something that can be done over time.

Your Activity chart is **the quickest way** a visitor has **to view** **your commitment to development**. If you only commit code once a week, then not only will your learning progress suffer, but also (and more importantly) a person who visits your GitHub profile might not actually believe that you're a strong engineer.
