- Complete all installations necessary to begin the program.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Description

In this lesson you will double-check that you have installed all tools that will be necessary. You should have them already on your machine, but this is the final check.

### Why is it important?

Very soon you will start coding your first projects. Having all of the tools set up ahead of time will save you time.

### First day installation list

From day one at Microverse, you need to make sure that you have installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- An IDE.It can be [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or any IDE of your preference.

- [Configure your GitHub account to use your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) so that you can push your code to GitHub quickly.
