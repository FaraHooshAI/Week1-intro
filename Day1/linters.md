### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description

A linter is a tool that analyzes your *source code* to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

You can find linters for most programming languages, read about [Top 6 Python Code Linters for every Data Scientist in 2022](https://www.datasciencelearner.com/top-5-python-code-linters-for-every-data-scientist/)

## Why are linters important?

There are a few reasons for using linters:

1. Catching syntax errors is more efficient. There is no need to debug simple mistakes like typos - the linter does it for you.
2. The entire codebase looks like it was written by one person.
3. Programmers can focus on solving problems instead of cleaning up the code.

As programmers, you will be part of a team. Agreeing on a set of [coding standards]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices#Coding_standard](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/coding-standards-best-practices#:~:text=Practices%20To%20Follow-,What%20are%20Coding%20Standards%3F,sophisticated%20and%20highly%20functional%20code.)) is key to create quality code as a team, and linters will facilitate this task.

## How can I use linters in my code base?

There are many ways you can integrate a linter in your programming workflow:

- IDE plugins
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub apps
